# DeepNutrition: Be Aware Of Your Macros

#### Ali Kayadibi, Ismet Okatar, Muhammed Aydogan

In 2015 107 million children and 603 million adult were obese. Having a high body mass index accounted for 4 million deaths in 2015. And more than two thirds of these were from heart disease. People can easily overeat without knowing how much calorie costs a food. There is applications to prevent that by measuring daily calorie intake by waiting from users to enter each of what they eat one by one. The long process to input reduces the sustainability of dietary assesment. Our aim is to facilitate that process and expect from users just to capture the photo before eating that meal. By that way capturing the photo can easily become a habit and people can raise their awareness in their diet with less volition. Our absolete aim is to capture multi-meal from one image as efficient as it can be.

This is our Term Project for our BBM409 Machine Learning Lab. Our aim is to post a blog post on medium every week to show the progress of the project.
